#### 20. Game Over Splash Screen Visual Adjustment

*   **Problem:** The "GAME OVER" title appeared too high and out of the splash screen board, and there was an unwanted visual "border" around the score submission form.
*   **Resolution:** Removed `padding` from the `.game-over-box` CSS class in `style.css` to make its content blend more seamlessly with the `game-over-screen` background, effectively removing the visual border.
*   **Deployment:** Instructed user to re-deploy the frontend code to apply these changes.
